# Personal Website - Web Development Project

## Overview
This is a personal website that I made for my Web Development class. Made using HTML and CSS, it includes a home page, a projects page, a resume page, and a "fun stuff" page.

## Installation Instructions
There is no server-side programming in this project, so this site can be hosted on any platform that accommodates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In other words, this site is entirely frontend. It consists of static files. There is no backend code, so this site doesn't need anything to run except a web browser. Any hosting service that can serve static files will work. So there is nothing to really "install" here in a traditional sense.

The site is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be viewed directly in a web browser. The link in the "Usage Instructions" leads to that.
